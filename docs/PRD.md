# Robert - The Memory Layer for AI
## Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

**Robert** is the neutral, trusted "Context OS" that sits between users and AI reasoning providers—combining **sophisticated memory control** with **agentic autonomy**. While tools like ChatGPT and Claude vertically integrate memory with reasoning, and Mem.ai offers "thought partnership" without action, Robert unbundles the AI stack AND executes workflows autonomously.

The AI market is bifurcating: **Reasoning** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) is becoming commoditized infrastructure, competing on price and intelligence per token. **Memory**—the proprietary, highly sensitive context that defines who the user is and what they know—remains locked in provider black boxes.

**The critical gap**: Current AI tools (ChatGPT, Mem.ai, Notion AI) are **retrieval engines, not execution engines**. Users ask questions, get answers, then manually execute workflows. Robert provides **domain-specific autonomous agents** that execute end-to-end workflows within user-defined boundaries.

Robert solves this through a **Firewalled Architecture + Agentic Execution**: Memory stays Personal (user-owned, structured, portable), while Reasoning remains Commoditized (rented, ephemeral, interchangeable). We manage the user's digital brain, structure it into a knowledge graph, and **autonomously execute workflows** using the reasoning model of their choice.

## Product Vision

**Context control + agentic execution: AI that acts on your behalf within defined domains.**

We believe AI should be:
- **Controllable**: Users curate what AI knows, not accept black-box profiles
- **Portable**: Memory travels across jobs, platforms, and providers
- **Segregated**: Personal vs. professional contexts kept separate
- **Transparent**: Users see what memories are active for any query
- **Firewalled**: Reasoning providers see anonymized context, never full user profiles
- **Platform-agnostic**: Works across Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android
- **Agentic**: Executes workflows autonomously, not just retrieves information

### The Problem

**Current AI systems have fatal flaws:**

1. **The "Mystery Meat" Profile**: Users have no control over what AI "knows." A business owner cannot tell ChatGPT: "Remember my 2024 pricing, but explicitly forget the 2019 PDF for generation purposes."

2. **Platform Fragmentation**: Context is scattered across devices and platforms. Apple Intelligence only works on Apple. Copilot only works on Microsoft. No neutral layer exists.

3. **Vertical Integration Conflicts**: To get smart answers, you must give OpenAI your data. To keep secrets, you must use a dumb model. No middle ground.

4. **The "Thought Partner" Trap (Mem.ai)**: Retrieval without execution. Users ask "What should I quote for this project?" AI retrieves pricing data and gives an answer. User still manually creates the quote in a separate tool. **No workflow execution, no domain ownership, no autonomy.**

5. **The "Walled Garden" Problem (Notion AI)**: Only indexes documents within Notion. Enterprise teams use Jira, Slack, Figma, Linear, Google Docs, email, and local files. **Notion AI can't answer cross-tool questions.** No intelligent context sharding across teams, roles, or personal vs. professional boundaries.

**What users actually need:**
- Curated intelligence without black-box memory
- Context segregation (work vs. personal, current job vs. portable career knowledge)
- Data portability when changing jobs or providers
- Cross-platform AI continuity
- Privacy through structural neutrality
- **Autonomous agents that execute workflows, not just retrieve information**
- **Universal indexing across all tools** (not locked to one vendor's ecosystem)
- **Sophisticated context sharding** (team graphs, personal graphs, role-based access, cross-tool intelligence)

### Our Solution

**ContextOS: An Operating System for AI Memory**

Robert is not just a chat client; it's a Memory Layer that enables:

- **The Sarah Test**: An interior designer marks a 2019 pricing document as "outdated" without deleting it. Robert keeps it for tax records but never uses it for pricing quotes. She "fine-tuned" her AI without writing code.

- **Firewalled Architecture**: Three-party model—User (local keys, hot state) → Robert (trusted utility cloud for sync/compute) → Reasoning Provider (untrusted, sees only anonymized context).

- **GraphRAG**: Knowledge graphs instead of simple vector search. Entities, relationships, temporal reasoning. Answers questions like "How has our strategy changed since last year?"—impossible for standard RAG.

- **Reactive Pruning**: Users don't organize proactively. They fix AI mistakes at the moment of frustration. Zero-cost curation when motivated.

- **Enterprise Network Effect**: Individual users curate personal knowledge graphs. Teams sync proprietary graphs (legal precedents, client portfolios). We monetize synchronization of structured wisdom, not compute.

### Competitive Landscape

**Why competitors can't build Robert:**

| Player | Conflict | Robert's Advantage |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| **OpenAI/Anthropic** | Business model relies on mining user data. Cannot credibly offer provider-neutral switching. | We have no conflict: protecting data *is* the business model. |
| **Apple/Microsoft/Google** | Platform lock-in is their strategy. Structurally cannot bridge ecosystems. | Platform-agnostic by design. The Dropbox lesson. |
| **Dropbox** | Most natural competitor and likely acquirer. Should build this. | Speed to market. Purpose-built, AI-native, no legacy business. |

**Robert's differentiators:**
- ✅ **ContextOS** - Sophisticated control over memory boundaries
- ✅ **Platform-agnostic** - Works everywhere, not just Apple/Microsoft ecosystems
- ✅ **Structural neutrality** - No business model conflict with data sovereignty
- ✅ **GraphRAG** - Knowledge graphs enable temporal reasoning
- ✅ **Firewalled privacy** - Anonymization proxy between user and reasoning providers

### Vision Statement

> "Just as the Browser unbundled the OS from the Web, Robert unbundles Memory from the Model—becoming the trusted gateway that ensures AI serves the user, not the other way around."

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can click "Mark as Outdated" on document in context sidebar
- Document remains in knowledge base for historical queries
- AI excludes archived documents from pricing-related generation
- User can query "What did we charge in 2019?" and get correct historical answer

**UI Flow:**
```
AI quotes wrong price → User sees 2019 doc in context sidebar →
Clicks "Mark as Outdated" → AI never uses that doc for pricing again
```

### US2: Context Segregation (Consultant)
**As a** consultant changing jobs
**I want to** separate my portable career knowledge from employer-specific context
**So that** I take my frameworks with me but leave client IP behind

## Business Model

### Phase 1: The Tool (Seed/Series A)
- **Target**: Developers & Prosumers (Mac Apple Silicon first)
- **Value**: "Vibe Coding" on local repos + Context Control
- **Model**: Freemium / Pro Subscription

**Pricing:**
- **Free Tier**: Local-only, single device, 1GB knowledge base
- **Pro ($10-20/mo)**: Cloud sync, 10GB, multi-device, priority support

### Phase 2: The Network (Series B)
- **Target**: Teams (5-50 employees)
- **Value**: Shared knowledge graphs with access control
- **Revenue**: $50/user/mo for team sync

**The Moat**: When a team curates a shared knowledge graph (legal precedents, client portfolios), it becomes a proprietary asset. We charge to sync that structured wisdom.

**Analogy**: GitHub doesn't own the code; they charge for collaboration. We charge for collaboration around Memory.

### Phase 3: Enterprise (Series B+)
- **Target**: Enterprises (500+ employees)
- **Value**: Context governance, compliance, audit trails
- **Revenue**: $200-500/user/mo

**The "Wedding Photos" Justification**: People pay for Google Photos before internet bills. Why? Risk of losing wedding photos is unbearable. Extrapolate to business knowledge graphs—a designer's 10-year portfolio, a law firm's precedents. Once curated, it's irreplaceable intellectual capital. Users will pay $200-500/year to protect years of work.

### Revenue Model Progression
- **Individual (Free or $10-20/mo)**: Customer acquisition, not profit center
- **Team ($50/user/mo)**: First real revenue
- **Enterprise ($200-500/user/mo)**: High-margin, sticky (>95% retention)

**Success Metric**: Path to $100M ARR = 100K individuals (break-even/CAC) + 20K teams ($120M potential) + 100 enterprises ($120M potential)

## Cuts

The following content represents earlier product directions that have been superseded by the ContextOS / Memory Layer vision. Preserved for historical reference.

### Deprecated: Browser Automation Product Vision

*The original PRD positioned Robert as a browser automation tool focused on visual feedback and local-first execution. This direction has been replaced by the ContextOS / Memory Layer for AI positioning.*

**Original Executive Summary** (Deprecated):
> Robert is an open-source, local-first browser automation tool that brings the power of automation to everyone—not just programmers. While tools like Zapier and IFTTT require API knowledge, Claude agents are complex to create, and GPT's interface provides no visibility, Robert lets users **watch automation happen in real-time**, learn by observation, and maintain full control with the ability to abort operations at any moment.

**Browser Automation Features** (Deprecated - may be revived in v3.0 as agentic workflows):
- Chrome automation via CDP
- Visual script builder
- Markdown-based automation scripts
- Screenshot and text capture
- Browser profile management
- Ephemeral sessions

**User Profiles and Multi-User Support** (Deprecated):
- Password-protected user profiles
- Browser profile isolation
- Command system with generative UI
- AI-assisted command refinement

**Chat-Driven AI Workflow System** (Deprecated):
- Injected chat interface on web pages
- AI-generated CDP scripts
- Template-based prompts
- Feedback loop for continuous improvement

**Workflow Learning System** (Deprecated - future feature):
- Workflow graph (`.workflow.md`)
- Step frame format (`.frames.json`)
- Confidence-based navigation
- Self-improving system

*Note: The browser automation capabilities remain technically viable and may be reintroduced as part of agentic workflows in v3.0+, but are no longer the primary product focus.*
