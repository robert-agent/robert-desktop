### Messaging for Mac Audience

**Core Message:**
> "Finally, browser automation that feels native to macOS‚Äîbeautiful, powerful, and built for how you actually work."

**Key Points:**
- **Native macOS app** - Not a web wrapper, truly native
- **Designed for Mac** - Respects macOS design language
- **Privacy-first** - Runs locally, no cloud required (Mac users value privacy)
- **Beautiful UI** - Eye-candy that Mac users expect
- **Simple yet powerful** - Voice-driven Markdown scripts + visual feedback

**Aspirational Positioning:**
- "The automation tool for people who care about craft"
- "Built for makers, designers, and thinkers"
- "Automation that respects your intelligence"

### Pricing Strategy (Premium Positioning)

**Free Tier (Open Source):**
- Full core functionality
- Local execution
- Community scripts
- No time limits

**Pro Tier ($9.99/month or $99/year):**
- Cloud sync for scripts
- Priority support
- Advanced features (scheduled runs, team sharing)
- Early access to new features

**Why charge Mac users?**
- They're willing to pay for quality
- Premium price signals premium quality
- Sustainable development
- But open source core ensures freedom and trust

### Success Metrics - Mac Launch

**Phase 1 (First 3 months):**

**2. Feedback Quality**
Mac users provide thoughtful, detailed feedback. They help refine the product before wider release.

**3. Social Proof**
When Mac users advocate, it creates FOMO for Windows/Linux users, building demand.

**4. Premium Association**
Starting on Mac creates premium brand perception, even though it's free/open source.

**5. Sustainable Growth**
Better to have 1,000 passionate Mac users than 10,000 lukewarm Windows users. Passion drives word-of-mouth.
