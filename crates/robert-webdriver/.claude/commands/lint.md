Run linting checks on the Rust codebase using cargo-xlint.

Commands to execute:
```bash
cargo xlint
```

This will run comprehensive linting including:
- cargo clippy with strict warnings
- Code formatting checks
- Additional custom lints configured for the project

If `cargo xlint` is not available, install it first:
```bash
cargo install cargo-xlint
```
